you divide the data?

11. You have a stream of data coming in, in the format as the following:
item_id, views, clicks, time
1            100     10         2013-11-28
1            1000   350       2013-11-29
1            200     14         2013-11-30
2            127     13         2013-12-1
…

The same id are consecutive.

Click through rate = clicks / views.
On every day, I want to output the item id when its click through rate is
larger than a given threshold.
For example, at day 1, item 1’s rate is 10/100=10%, day2, its (10+350)/(100
+1000)=0.32. day3 it is (10+350+14)/(100+1000+200)=0.28.
If my threshold is 0.3, then at day 1, I don’t output. On day2 I output. On
day3, I don’t output.
